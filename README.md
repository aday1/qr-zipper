About QR Code Zipper & Unzipper

Security Features

This application includes several security features:

    Password Protection: AES encryption for your data
    MD5 Verification: Ensures data integrity during multi-part transfers
    Local Processing: All operations happen in your browser, no data is sent to servers

Chunking and P2P Features

For files larger than a single QR code can handle:

    Data is automatically split into multiple chunks
    Each chunk includes position information and an MD5 checksum
    Use the P2P Transfer mode to transfer large files between devices

Tips for Best Results

    For P2P transfers, ensure good lighting and a stable camera position
    Adjust the display interval based on your camera scanning speed
    Keep passwords simple but secure to avoid typing errors
    When scanning, ensure the QR code is fully visible in the camera
    For large files, use a slower display interval to ensure reliable scanning
